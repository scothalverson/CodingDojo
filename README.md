Code for Los ALamos Coding Dojo, Conway's Game of Life Edition

Code included:

	randomGenerator.py
		Syntax:  
			./randomGenerator.py <rows> <columns> <outfile>
		where:
			<rows> is a positive integer specifying the number of rows in the output file
			<columns> is a positive integer specifying the number of columns in the output file
			<outfile> is a the (ascii text) file to which the data will written

	rleReader.py
		Syntax:  
			./rleReader.py <infile> <outfile> <padding>
		where:
			<infile> is the .rle input file, probably generated by Golly.  Note that this
				file is assumed to be a standard (not extended) .rle file using the B3/S23
				rule set.  If this is not the case, the rleReader may still work, but I 
				make no promises.
			<outfile> is the (ascii text) file to which the data will be written.
			<padding> is a positive integer specifying the width/height of a buffer region
				of '0' values that will be appended to the domain.
